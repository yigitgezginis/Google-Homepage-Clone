# Google-Homepage Clone

## Purpose
In this project, I wanted to improve my layout skills using different CSS structures. Also, there are few dynamic codes using CSS conditionals. By going deep on the source code, you will see more.

# How to Run?
After you install all the dependencies, open .html file with any browser you want.
Note: Some browsers may not run the code as intended (For ex: Safari).
