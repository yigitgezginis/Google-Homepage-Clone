# Google-Homepage Clone

## Purpose
In this project, I wanted to improve my layout skills using different CSS structures. Also, there are few dynamic codes using CSS conditionals. By going deep on the source code, you will see more.

After you install all the dependencies, open .html file with any browser you want.
Note: Some browsers may not run the code as intended (For ex: Safari).
